Dear,
This is arduino microcontroller based robot, here Infrared sensor was used to track/follow line.  
The robot uses infrared (IR) sensors to detect black/white surfaces and follows a predefined path.
The repository includes Arduino codes, wiring diagrams, and learning materials so that students can build the robot step by step.
All the codes are available in .ino file formate.

Have a great day & Happy Learning!
